//! Where does an LFM2 decode token's time actually go? CPU or GPU, and why.
//!
//! Measurement harness for lloom issue #7 / `DESIGN.md` §3.4, §6.6, §11.2,
//! §16 P0 #1 and #4.
//!
//! Three numbers, measured in one run so they describe the same execution:
//!
//! * **wall time per decode token** — measured independently rather than
//!   inherited from the ~27 ms/token recorded in `DESIGN.md` §6.6.
//! * **GPU busy time per decode token** — the union of every command buffer's
//!   `GPUStartTime`..`GPUEndTime` in the window, via `CANDLE_METAL_PROFILE=1`.
//! * **dispatch count per decode token** — counted, not inherited from §11.2's
//!   ~240 estimate.
//!
//! `wall - gpu_busy` is the time the GPU was not executing. In a serial decode
//! loop with nothing to overlap against, that is CPU-side encode, submission and
//! readback: the answer to §16 P0 #1.
//!
//! # Why prefill is measured separately
//!
//! Prefill runs one forward pass over the whole prompt and decode runs one per
//! token. Averaging them together makes ms/token a function of prompt length,
//! which is how a decode figure ends up describing something else. The prompt's
//! forward pass is timed into its own bucket and excluded from the decode
//! average.
//!
//! # Why a warmup token is excluded
//!
//! The first decode token pays for pipeline compilation, buffer-pool growth and
//! page faults on freshly mmap'd weights. Those are real costs, but they are
//! one-time, and a steady-state figure is what the roofline in §16 P0 #4 is
//! being compared against. `--warmup` tokens are timed and reported, then left
//! out of the steady-state average.
//!
//! ```bash
//! CANDLE_METAL_PROFILE=1 cargo run --release --features metal \
//!   --example lfm2-decode-profile -- --n 200
