//! Is candle's decode dispatch sequence identical across tokens?
//!
//! Measurement harness for lloom issue #6 / `DESIGN.md` §11.1a, §16 P0 #2.
//!
//! An `MTLIndirectCommandBuffer` is only replayable if the command sequence is
//! identical between invocations. Candle is eager — ops execute as called, and
//! nothing guarantees the next forward pass issues the same dispatches against
//! the same buffers. This records (pipeline, buffers, grid) per dispatch across
//! N decode tokens and diffs consecutive tokens.
//!
//! The model driver is the one from the determinism probe
//! (`candle-examples/examples/lfm2-determinism`, lloom issue #5), so this
//! measures the same decode path that was shown to be bit-deterministic rather
//! than a second, differently-wrong reimplementation of it.
//!
//! Three outcomes are distinguished, because they have different consequences:
//!
//! * **identical** — replay is possible; the executor work is justified.
//! * **differs only in buffer identity** — the allocator hands out different
//!   buffers for the same logical slot. Fixable, and it makes the allocator a
//!   prerequisite rather than a parallel track.
//! * **differs structurally** — kernel, grid or binding shape changes. Replay
//!   would need the model to declare stability.
//!
//! ```bash
//! CANDLE_METAL_TRACE=1 cargo run --release --example lfm2-dispatch-trace -- --n 24
//! ```
//!
//! Without `CANDLE_METAL_TRACE=1` the instrumentation is inert and the harness
//! says so rather than reporting an empty trace as a result.
