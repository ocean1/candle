//! Does LFM2 still answer a question? A two-turn text smoke test.
//!
//! Harness for lloom issue #121, and the tool `CONTRIBUTING.md` §3.1a asks for.
//!
//! # The gap this fills
//!
//! Every LFM2 run on this project reports **digests and never text**.
//! `lfm2-determinism` loads a tokenizer, uses it to *encode*, and decodes
//! nothing — so fifty commits of kernel work have been validated entirely on
//! `5e5ba45a…` matching `5e5ba45a…`.
//!
//! That is the right gate for *"did this change the computation"* and it is
//! blind to *"is the model still answering questions."* **A digest is equally
//! stable whether the model is coherent or emitting the same garbage every
//! run** — §2.3.1's three kinds of determinism are independent, and §2.3.5a
//! says it plainly: a build can be reproducible and wrong at once.
//!
//! # Why a sibling binary rather than a `--show-text` flag
//!
//! Issue #121 asks for the argument. Three reasons, and the third is the one
//! that decides it:
//!
//! 1. **The digest path stays byte-for-byte what it was.** A flag would put a
//!    `tokenizer.decode` inside the loop whose output is the gate every kernel
//!    change is measured against, and §2.4's standing rule is to check whether
//!    the measurement tool is the cost. Here the property is stronger than
//!    "measured and found not to perturb": `lfm2-determinism` is *not edited*,
//!    so its digests are unchanged by construction rather than by experiment.
//! 2. **The two harnesses want opposite prompts.** The determinism gate wants a
//!    long open-ended prompt generating hundreds of tokens across turns, which
//!    is what makes it a strong test (§2.3.6 — long multi-turn is strongest).
//!    This wants a *short* prompt with one checkable answer. One binary serving
//!    both means one prompt set, and whichever wins the other check is weaker.
//! 3. **This project already made this split once, and paid for getting it
//!    wrong.** `lfm2-determinism` printed a `tok_per_s` that was not throughput
//!    for twenty-odd issues and misled two readers, including a reviewer of #97
//!    (§2.4, lloom #102). The lesson recorded there is that the two harnesses
//!    have separate jobs — *"this one measures digests, `lfm2-decode-profile`
//!    measures throughput"* — and a number needing a caveat every time it is
//!    read is a number better not printed beside a different quantity. Adding a
//!    text check to the digest harness is the same shape of decision, and it is
//!    declined for the same reason.
//!
//! The cost of a sibling is a duplicated model loader. That is the convention
//! all three existing LFM2 harnesses already follow (`lfm2-decode-profile` and
//! `lfm2-dispatch-trace` each carry their own `parse_config`), and it is what
//! keeps them independently revertible (`CONTRIBUTING.md` §4.1).
//!
//! # The two turns, and why that shape
//!
//! **Turn 1 — a completion with an obvious continuation.** A broken model fails
//! this *visibly and instantly*: repetition, a wrong token, an immediate EOS —
//! where a digest reports a stable hash of the same failure.
//!
//! Note it still goes through the chat template. `lfm2-determinism`'s
//! `--raw-prompt` records the finding: without the template LFM2 emits EOS at
//! the first step and then degenerates, which measures nothing.
//!
//! **Turn 2 — a fact against the accumulated cache.** By this point KV has
//! grown, conv state has been shuffled 22 times per token (§5.3 — twenty-*two*
//! conv layers, corrected by #88; §6.1 is the shuffle), and a second prefill
//! runs on top of both. **If turn 2 is wrong while turn 1 was fine, the cache is
//! the suspect** — which is a sharper signal than a moved digest, because it
//! says *where*.
//!
//! # Three constraints, each load-bearing
//!
//! 1. **Greedy and seeded.** `Sampling::ArgMax`, not top-p. Under sampling turn
//!    2's substring check is a coin flip and the harness becomes flaky — which
//!    is *worse than absent*, because a flaky gate gets ignored and then gets
//!    deleted.
//! 2. **The checks exit non-zero.** `"Paris"` is a low bar, and a low bar that
//!    actually fires is worth more than a high bar nobody runs.
//!
//!    **Both turns carry a substring check, and the first one was added after a
//!    mutation defeated the harness.** Turn 1 originally asserted only that some
//!    text came back. Narrowing §6.1's conv-state shuffle the wrong way
//!    degenerated the completion from `"…jumps over the lazy dog."` to `"The
//!    quick brown"` — 10 tokens to 3 — and this harness reported **PASS** while
//!    the digest gate reported a well-formed, changed digest pair and exit 0.
//!    Neither caught it. That is §11.3j's vacuous-parity-arm lesson in a second
//!    place: a guard that survives the defect it exists to catch is not a guard,
//!    and "the model emitted something" is that shape of guard.
//! 3. **Not a quality benchmark.** No perplexity, no scoring, no model
//!    comparison, and deliberately no timing — the question is *did the model
//!    stop working*, nothing more. §2.4 and lloom #102 are why there is no
//!    `tok_per_s` here either.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! **Not a replacement for the digest gate.** Both, and they catch different
//! things: this one cannot tell you *which* kernel moved. Run it beside
//! `lfm2-determinism`, not instead of it.
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --release --features metal --example lfm2-smoke -- --attn generic
//! cargo run --release --features metal --example lfm2-smoke -- --attn sdpa
//! ```
//!
//! Both arms must print the same text while their digests legitimately differ
//! (§2.3.8c) — which is the single best demonstration of why this test exists.
