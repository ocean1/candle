//! Admission at configuration time (lloom #186, `DESIGN.md` §9.5).
//!
//! §9.5d's check is *"predict the peak from `(model, max_context, B, scratch
//! policy)` and refuse before allocating"*, and §9.5k's residual is the derived
//! cap on everything the five classes do not name. This file is the
//! model-level half: that the check runs where it must, that it refuses and
//! admits, and that the RoPE tables — built in `Cache::new_with` **before**
//! anything else and not one of §9.1's five classes — are accounted for.
//!
//! # Both bounds, and why that is the load-bearing property
//!
//! **An admission check that refuses everything is not a check** (§8.1g's rule,
//! and #184's precedent of pinning both bounds for exactly this reason). Every
//! refusal assertion here has an admission assertion beside it. The mutation
//! that motivates it is trivial to write and impossible to see from a green
//! suite that only tests the refusal.
//!
//! # What is not tested here, stated rather than left to be noticed
//!
//! **Nothing in this file runs a forward pass or touches a GPU.** Admission is
//! a pure function of the configuration — that is what makes it free (§9.5e) —
//! so it is testable without a device, and the residual *branch* is tested
//! where it lives, in `candle-metal-kernels`' `buffer_pool` suite. What a Metal
//! device would add is the real `recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize` in place of the
//! `hw.memsize` stand-in, which changes the arithmetic's inputs and not its
//! shape.
