//! Admission against a real Metal device (lloom #186, `DESIGN.md` §9.5l).
//!
//! The unit tests in `lfm2_admission_tests.rs` are pure arithmetic against a
//! `hw.memsize` stand-in. **This one builds a `Cache` on the device**, which is
//! the only thing that exercises three properties the arithmetic cannot:
//!
//! * that `admit_memory_budget` is *reached* from `Cache::new_with` at all;
//! * that it runs **before** the RoPE tables, which are allocated in that same
//!   function and are the reason the ordering matters (§9.5k);
//! * that the real denominator is used, which is **not** `hw.memsize` —
//!   `recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize` reads **55.663 GB** on this machine against
//!   `hw.memsize`'s 68.719 (§9.5l).
//!
//! **This was worth writing, and the reason is recorded rather than implied.**
//! The unit tests were green while admission was compiling to its non-Metal
//! stub in every harness — `candle-examples`' `metal` feature did not propagate
//! `candle-transformers/metal`, so the `#[cfg(feature = "metal")]` arm was
//! never built. Nothing that tested the *arithmetic* could have seen that; only
//! building a `Cache` and watching it refuse can.
