//! Why the verify pass needed a conv writer of its own — the **prefill** branch,
//! pinned.
//!
//! `DESIGN.md` §10.2a's rollback contract costs the conv half's `resolve(n)` at
//! *"a pointer move"*, and §6.1 describes the decode conv path. Both are about
//! `ShortConv::forward`'s `seq_len == 1` branch. A K-position pass takes a
//! different branch, and **this file is the measurement that established the
//! ordinary `seq_len > 1` branch cannot serve a verify pass** — which is why
//! `Cache::advance` exists and why the speculative branch beside it was written.
//!
//! **These tests run without `advance()`, so they exercise the prefill path,
//! and that is deliberate**: prefill's rebuild is correct for prefill and must
//! not change. They assert the property that made a second writer necessary, so
//! that a future change collapsing the two paths turns them red rather than
//! silently making rollback wrong. `lfm2_spec_conv_rollback.rs` is the arm that
//! exercises the speculative writer.
//!
//! CPU only: the question is which bytes survive a call, not what a kernel
//! computes, and the CPU backend is bit-stable (`CONTRIBUTING.md` §3.1).
