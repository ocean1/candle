//! LFM2 (Liquid Foundation Model 2) implementation.
//!
//! LFM2 is a hybrid architecture that combines attention and short convolution layers.
//! See [LiquidAI](https://www.liquid.ai/) for more information.
//!
//! This implementation supports the LFM2ForCausalLM architecture from HuggingFace transformers.

/// §10.2a specifies "a rotating base into a `(l_cache + K)`-wide buffer" and

/// reads", and the second clause is false: `sum_keepdim` accumulates in *slot*
/// order, so rotating which slot holds which token rotates the summation order.
/// Float addition is not associative, so the low bits move.
///
/// **That makes the rotating arm a different summation order, not a defect —
/// established by measurement, not by assumption** (issue #141, `DESIGN.md`
/// §10.2g). §2.3.5a names CPU-backend parity as the only load-bearing
/// discriminator between a legitimate reduction-order change and a computational
/// bug, and the rotating arm passes it: exact against an independent f64
/// reference on the reduction it reorders, and its LFM2 error does not grow over

///   compaction — §10.2a's own second fallback ("a doubled buffer"), generalised
///   with `slack` as how much doubling is paid for.
/// - [`ConvState::RotatingRing`] is §10.2a as specified. It never compacts, so
///   its dispatch count is **constant** and its write offsets take one of
///   `l_cache + k` fixed values — both of which the sliding arm gives up
///   (§10.2e). It moves the digests.
///
