/// clone through its `MetalStorage`. A `Drop` written on `MetalDevice` itself
/// would therefore fire on **every tensor drop** -- hundreds of times per decode

/// makes it a regression rather than a subtlety.

/// Holding the guard behind an `Arc` moves the trigger to the instant the last
/// handle goes, which is what the panic log shows actually happening:
/// `main+5200` -> `drop_in_place<MetalDevice>` -> `Arc::drop_slow`, on the main
/// thread past the `RESULT` line.

/// # Why it is declared first
///
/// Fields drop in declaration order, and this must run **before** `commands`,
/// `buffers` and `private_buffers` -- the pools are what free the `MTLBuffer`s
/// the set still lists, and removing an object that is already gone is what
