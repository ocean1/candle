//! lloom #345, following #277 (`DESIGN.md` §11.2c). The Metal kernel wrote two
//! elements per thread -- `out[tid]` and `out[size - off - tid]` -- from two
//! CONSECUTIVE states of one `HybridTaus` stream. Consecutive outputs of that
//! generator are a deterministic function of one another, so the pair is
//! supported on a curve in the unit square rather than filling it.
//!
//! **Every marginal check passes on that kernel.** Per-position means are
//! uniform, pairwise correlation is ~0, and successive calls are independent.
//! `candle-metal-kernels`' own `random` test asserts range and mean and is
//! structurally incapable of seeing this (`DESIGN.md` §15.1a's INEXPRESSIVE
//! class). What fails is the property GPU sampling actually depends on:
//!
//!   with equal weights, the argmax over a drawn vector must be uniform
//!   over positions.
//!
//! The maximum is a TAIL statistic, so a source can have correct marginals and
//! zero correlation and still place its maxima wrongly. That is why this
//! survived: nothing was asking the question the max asks.
//!
//! These tests are the mutation control for the fix. On the pre-#345 kernel
//! they read chi-squared 300 / 772 / 1485 / 29 200 at n = 4 / 8 / 16 / 256
//! against critical values 16.27 / 24.32 / 37.70 / 330.55, i.e. they FAIL by
//! one to two orders of magnitude.
//!
//! Metal only: the CPU and CUDA backends draw from their own generators and are
//! not affected by the `.metal` change this pins. The tests are `#[cfg]`-gated
//! rather than made backend-generic for that reason.
