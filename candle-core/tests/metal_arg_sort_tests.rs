#![cfg(feature = "metal")]
//! `Tensor::arg_sort_last_dim` on Metal, at widths past one threadgroup.
//!
//! # What was wrong
//!
//! `ArgSort::metal_fwd` rounded `ncols` up to a power of two and called
//! `call_arg_sort`, which dispatches **one threadgroup of `ncols_pad` threads**.
//! A Metal threadgroup holds at most **1024** (lloom `DESIGN.md` §3.1), so at
//! LFM2's 128 000-wide vocabulary the dispatch asked for 131 072 — 128× the
//! limit — and the kernel returned zeros.
//!
//! It returned them **silently**, and that is the part worth keeping: the
//! obvious predicate, *"is each element ≥ the next?"*, is satisfied by
//! `v[0] >= v[0]` at every step, so an all-zeros output looks sorted. §15.1 #1
//! already says to prefer *"at least two distinct values"* to *"not all zero"*;
//! these tests check the result is a **permutation**, which is what
//! discriminates, and `a_sortedness_check_alone_cannot_discriminate` pins the
//! trap so it is not fallen into again.
//!
//! # What the fix is
//!
//! `call_mlx_arg_sort` routes to a multi-block sort with no width limit. It is
//! **not** a drop-in replacement — it sorts ascending only, and covers six
//! dtypes where this entry point names nine — so it is taken exactly where it
//! applies, and the single-threadgroup path is kept for the rest, where below
//! the limit it is correct and above it now **fails loudly** rather than
//! returning zeros.
