#![cfg(feature = "metal")]
//! `Device::set_seed` must actually reach the Metal RNG kernel.
//!
//! # The defect these pin
//!
//! `random.metal`'s `atomic_load_seed` reconstructs the 64-bit seed from two
//! 32-bit atomics as `(ulong)seed[0] << 32 | seed[1]` — **word 0 is the HIGH
//! half**. `MetalDevice::set_seed` copied a native `u64`, which on a
//! little-endian host puts the **LOW** half in word 0, so the kernel read
//! `swap32(seed)`.
//!
//! A permuted seed would still be a seed. What made this fatal is the next
//! step: `HybridTaus::seed_per_thread` computes
//! `uint4(ulong4(seeds) * ulong4(PHI…) * ulong4(1099087573))`, and `uint4`
//! **truncates to the low 32 bits**. For any seed below `2^32` the swap makes
//! the kernel's value `seed << 32`, whose low 32 bits are zero — and every
//! multiple of it keeps them zero. So the seed-bearing component was
//! identically `0`, and the remaining three components of the vector are
//! `{tid, 1, 1}`.
//!
//! **The generated stream was therefore a function of `tid` alone**, and every
//! seed the public API can express produced byte-identical output.
//!
//! # Why this is not merely untidy
//!
//! `candle_nn::sampling::gumbel_softmax` draws its Gumbel variates from
//! `rand_like`, so a sampler built on it is reproducible **for the wrong
//! reason**: the stream repeats because the seed is not an input, not because
//! it is a respected one. A "seeded reproduction" gate over such a run passes
//! while measuring nothing (lloom `DESIGN.md` §15.1a's VACUOUS class), and
//! lloom #277 measured exactly that before this was found.
//!
//! # What is fixed, and what is a bound
//!
//! The fix is host-side: `set_seed` writes the two 32-bit words in the order
//! the kernel reads them. **32 bits of the seed reach the generator, not 64** —
//! `seed_per_thread` truncates to `uint4` and the vector's other components are
//! `{tid, 1, 1}`, so there is nowhere for the high half to go without changing
//! `random.metal`. That is a real limit, it is pinned by
//! `the_seeds_low_32_bits_are_what_reach_the_kernel` below, and it is left in
//! place because widening it would move every existing seed's meaning on a file
//! shared with the CPU and CUDA backends, to buy keyspace nothing here needs.
