#![cfg(feature = "metal")]
//! Ordering of blit-encoded copies against the last writer of their operands.
//!
//! `BlitCommandEncoder::copy_from_buffer` waited on the last writer of its
//! *source* but not of its *destination*, where the sibling `fill_buffer`
//! waited on its destination. These exercise both primitives after closing
//! that asymmetry.
//!
//! # Why the destination edge is not redundant
//!
//! `Commands::blit_command_encoder` already waits on every fence in
//! `live_fences` before handing a blit encoder out, which looks like it should
//! subsume any per-buffer wait. It does, for *compute* encoders: those register
//! their fence in `live_fences` in `Commands::end_encoding`.
//!
//! A *blit* encoder does not. `BlitCommandEncoder::end_encoding` registers its
//! outputs in `prev_ce_outputs` and updates its own fence, but never adds that
//! fence to `live_fences`. So a blit that writes buffer B followed by a second
//! blit that writes B again has a write-after-write dependency the blanket wait
//! cannot see; `prev_ce_outputs` is the only place it is recorded.
//!
//! Under `HazardTrackingModeUntracked` there is no safety net: a missed
//! dependency corrupts silently rather than failing.
//!
//! # What these tests do NOT show, stated up front
//!
//! **They do not fail when the destination wait is reverted.** Removing every
//! per-buffer wait from the blit encoder -- a strictly larger mutation -- leaves
//! all of them green, in release and in debug. So they are a regression guard
//! on the values, not a test of the ordering property, and they are labelled as
//! such rather than presented as evidence the edge was needed.
//!
//! The reason is measured, not assumed: instrumented on a real LFM2 decode,
//! `copy_from_buffer`'s destination has a registered last writer in **0** of
//! its calls. The edge is structurally right and, on the paths reachable here,
//! never live -- so there is nothing for a mutation to break. A test that could
//! fail would need a destination that genuinely carries a pending writer, and
//! no candle path observed here produces one.
//!
//! These also do **not** test the grouped-convolution corruption, which is a
//! different mechanism the fence machinery cannot observe at all, and which
//! this change does not fix.
