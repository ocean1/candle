//! A/B harness for the scratch class's sizing policies (`DESIGN.md` §9.1, #71).
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! Three sizing policies are compiled and **none is chosen**, because the regime
//! that would choose one is long context and the largest `kv_len` this project
//! has ever recorded is 2720 (§13.2; `.bench/` §3 enumerates the gap). This
//! harness is the mechanism that would *generate* the evidence, which the issue
//! names as the deliverable rather than the choice.
//!
//! It reports two things at every `kv_len`, and the separation is the point:
//!
//! - **footprint and waste**, which are computed and exact -- pure arithmetic
//!   over the plan, no device, no timing, no noise;
//! - **whether every policy computes the same bits**, which is executed.
//!
//! The second is the acceptance bar, not the first. The issue is explicit: *a
//! policy that changes numerics is a bug, not a tradeoff.* A footprint table is
//! only interesting once the arms are known to be comparable.
//!
//! # What it does not report, and why that is deliberate
//!
//! **No timing.** Nothing on the LFM2 path dispatches these kernels -- the real
//! FlashDecoding kernel is Phase 4/5 (§17 items 14, 16) -- so a wall-clock
//! comparison here would be measuring a stub. §6.6a's rule is that a measurement
//! which cannot resolve its effect is not evidence in either direction, and
//! §11.3k applied it by running no A/B at all rather than a meaningless one.
//!
//! **Every row above `kv_len` 2720 is marked `unmeasured`**, per #60's
//! convention: the sizes are computed from the geometry and the *behaviour* at
//! those lengths has never been observed. Computed is not measured, and the
//! table says which is which in its own column rather than in a footnote.
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --release --example scratch_ab
//! cargo run --release --example scratch_ab -- --kv-len 32768 --layout interleaved
//! ```
