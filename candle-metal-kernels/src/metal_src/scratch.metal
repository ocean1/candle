// FlashDecoding partials: the scratch class, and its sizing policy as a
// compile-tier template parameter (`DESIGN.md` §9.1, §10.4, issue #71).
//
// # What this is, and what it is emphatically not
//
// **This does not implement FlashDecoding.** That kernel is Phase 4/5 (§17
// items 14, 16). What is here writes the partials region in exactly the shape a
// real partial kernel would, and merges it in exactly the order §10.4 requires,
// so the *memory behaviour* -- sizing, addressing, fencing, merge order -- can
// be designed and tested before the arithmetic exists. The issue asks for this
// explicitly: "drive the allocation from a stub that writes the right shape".
//
// The stub writes a value derived from `(head, chunk, lane)` rather than a
// constant, and that is deliberate. §15.1 #1 (and #53, §11.3j) records that two
// kernels which both write nothing agree perfectly, so a parity assertion over
// constant output is vacuous -- and §3.7a names all-zero output as the *ICB
// path's characteristic failure*. A stub that wrote zeros would be untestable in
// exactly the way this project has already been bitten by.
//
// # Sizing as a template parameter, and why compile tier
//
// §7.2's rule assigns the tier: **if changing it changes how many registers a
// thread needs, it is compile tier.** Sizing changes addressing and loop bounds,
// so it is compile tier -- all variants pre-built, selected at construction.
//
// The precedent is already in this tree. `reduce.metal` carries
// `template<typename OP, ushort BLOCKSIZE, typename T>` -- a **non-dtype policy
// parameter** -- and §11.3b's `ParamStyle` is the Rust-side mirror of the same
// idea. `SIZING` here is that move applied to a third axis.
//
// Which policy wins is **unmeasured**, because the regime that distinguishes
// them is long context and the largest `kv_len` this project has ever recorded
// is 2720 (§13.2, `.bench/` §3). So none is chosen: all three compile, and the
// A/B that would choose one is the deliverable rather than the choice.
