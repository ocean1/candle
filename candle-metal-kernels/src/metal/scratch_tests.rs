//! Arithmetic tests for the scratch class (`DESIGN.md` §9.1, issue #71).
//!
//! Pure functions, no device: [`plan_scratch`] allocates nothing, so the sizing
//! arithmetic is testable without a GPU and the fixtures can carry shapes LFM2
//! never produces. The GPU-side tests -- disjointness, the fence, the merge
//! order as executed -- are in `scratch_gpu_tests.rs`.
//!
//! # The rule every fixture here obeys, and why it is stated at the top
//!
//! **Any fixture for arena arithmetic must contain a size that is not a multiple
//! of [`ARENA_ALIGNMENT`], or it is testing the identity function.**
//!
//! That is #70's warning, now §9.2c. Every LFM2 decode activation is a
//! 128-multiple, so `align_up` is a no-op on every shape our own model produces:
//! #70 **deleted `align_up` and its acceptance test still passed**, until a
//! deliberately unaligned size was added to the fixture.
//!
//! The scratch class is the first consumer where this bites -- but **only at one
//! of two levels**, which is finer than #70 stated it and is the thing that
//! decides whether a fixture can fail at all. See
