//! The scratch class on the device: disjointness, the fence, and the merge
//! order **as executed** (`DESIGN.md` §9.4, §10.4, issue #71).
//!
//! `scratch_tests.rs` covers the arithmetic, which needs no GPU. These are the
//! three properties that can only be established by running:
//!
//! 1. **N partials writing disjoint regions need no fences between them**, and
//!    the disjointness is *our* assertion rather than the driver's (§3.5). So it
//!    is checked by execution -- run them, read every byte back, and show no
//!    region was touched by another's dispatch.
//! 2. **The KV append must be fenced before the partials read** (§9.4). Easy to
//!    forget "because it is not between the two things one is thinking about",
//!    so the test is written to **fail without the fence**, mechanistically
//!    rather than by sampling a race.
//! 3. **The combine merges in index order** (§10.4). Asserted against the order
//!    the kernel actually walked, recorded by the kernel itself -- an ordering
//!    that cannot be observed cannot be asserted.

/// # Why this is the easy one to forget
///
/// §9.4 says it in those words: *easy to forget because it is not between the
/// two things one is thinking about.* The two things one is thinking about are
/// the partials and the combine, and the fence between **those** falls out of
/// `auto_barrier` because the combine reads what the partials wrote. The KV
/// append is upstream of both, and if the partials read KV that the append has
/// not finished writing, the answer is wrong intermittently -- §2.3.2's most
/// expensive bug class, and §3.5 says there is no safety net.
///
/// # Mechanistic, not stochastic
///
/// A test that ran the two dispatches and looked for corruption would be
/// sampling a race, and §6.3b records that a flake rate is **not usable as
/// evidence on its own**: the same unfixed binary measured 12/30, then 2/60,
/// then 16/60. So this asserts on the **mechanism** instead -- the barrier
/// `auto_barrier` emits, observed at its emission site by `trace::record_barrier`
/// (§9.2f: observed rather than simulated, because a simulation of this quantity
/// cannot be calibrated).
///
/// The mutation is the whole test: the same two dispatches with the KV buffer
/// **not** declared as an input to the partials emit no barrier, and the
/// assertion catches it.
