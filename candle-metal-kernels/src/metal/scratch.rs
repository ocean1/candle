//! The scratch class: kernel scratch sized by `kv_len` (`DESIGN.md` §9.1, #71).
//!
//! # The class §9.1 was missing, and why it is the one worth getting right
//!
//! §9.1 names four memory classes -- weights, conv state, KV cache, activations.
//! FlashDecoding partials are none of them. §9.4 counts their *fences* (two per
//! attention layer per step) and nothing in the document sized them. At B=1,
//! F32 accumulation, page size 256 (§10.4):
//!
//! ```text
//! kv_len   2,720 (the largest ever measured) ->   11 chunks -> 0.09 MB
//! kv_len  32,768                             ->  128 chunks -> 1.03 MB
//! kv_len 131,072                             ->  512 chunks -> 4.12 MB
//! kv_len 262,144                             -> 1024 chunks -> 8.25 MB
//! ```
//!
//! Against a **68 KB** activation arena (§9.2c, measured by #68), that is ~62x
//! at 128k. It is also the **only class whose size depends on `kv_len`**, which
//! is the axis this project has never entered -- every measurement in
//! `measurements/` is at `kv_len` < 2720.
//!
//! It cannot be shrunk to f16. Partials accumulate in F32 per §8.1 principle 4,
//! and the combine merges in index order per §10.4's determinism constraint --
//! see [`CombineOrder`].
//!
//! # Sizing is a variant axis, not a decision
//!
//! Three policies are plausible and **which one wins is unmeasured**, because
//! the regime that distinguishes them is long context. So none is picked:
//! [`Sizing`] is a compile-tier policy in §7.1's sense, all three variants are
//! compiled, and the choice is made at construction. That is exactly the
//! discipline `ParamStyle` follows for binding styles (§11.3b) and
//! [`ArenaLayout`](super::ArenaLayout) for layouts -- keeping every variant live
//! is what makes the A/B free and keeps the comparison between paths that exist
//! rather than between one path and an argument.
//!
//! §7.2 assigns the tier: sizing changes addressing and loop bounds, so it is
//! **compile tier**, pre-built and selected at construction. The Metal-side
//! precedent is already in the tree -- `reduce.metal` carries
//! `template<typename OP, ushort BLOCKSIZE, typename T>`, a non-dtype policy
//! parameter -- and this is the Rust-side mirror of the same move.
//!
//! # Why this lands here rather than inside a later KV issue
//!
//! **This is the API the KV cache work will build on.** Getting the policy seam
//! right once, statically, means the KV allocator inherits a shape rather than
//! inventing one -- and static means deterministic, which §2.3 makes an
//! invariant rather than a preference.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not do
//!
//! **It does not implement FlashDecoding.** The kernel is Phase 4/5 (§17). This
//! sizes and allocates its scratch, and a stub that writes the right *shape*
//! drives the allocation, because the memory behaviour is what is being
//! designed. Nothing here computes attention.
