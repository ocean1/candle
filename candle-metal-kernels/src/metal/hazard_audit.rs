//! Strict ordering verification: reconstruct the dependency graph and assert
//! every edge is covered (issue #185).
//!
//! # What this answers, and why a digest cannot
//!
//! Under `HazardTrackingModeUntracked` (`DESIGN.md` §3.5) the driver does no
//! dependency analysis, so a wrongly-dropped ordering edge is **silent
//! corruption rather than an error**. The project's two gates -- §15.1 #7's
//! determinism digest and §15.1 #8's `lfm2-smoke` -- are both *outcome* tests,
//! and #144 measured that neither can see this class:
//!
//! > A predicate wrong in exactly the way §11.3p warns against passes too.
//! > Mutating production source to suppress the **30 run heads** moves
//! > `suppressed` to 32225 and leaves the digest **identical**, over three runs.
//!
//! The ordering survived by luck -- every run head happens to be preceded by a
//! classically-encoded gap position that emits -- and luck is not a property a
//! second model family inherits (#92, #90, #91). §11.0a states the rule this
//! module exists to satisfy: *can the instrument express the difference it is
//! meant to detect?* A digest expresses **inequality**; this expresses **which
//! edge, between which two dispatches, in which direction, and why it is or is
//! not ordered**.
//!
//! # Three primitives, and the cover must span all of them
//!
//! §11.3o: *an ordering count is only interpretable against a fixed primitive*,
//! and three appear in this one question. They are not commensurable, so the
//! audit models each separately and an edge is covered when **any** orders it:
//!
//! | primitive | what it is | what it orders |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `memoryBarrierWithScope` | a fence **in the stream** | everything before it against everything after, *including* the interleaved gap positions |
//! | the ICB's `setBarrier` | a property of **one command** | that command against its predecessors **within its own run**; successors inherit nothing |
//! | an encoder-session seam | a fresh `EncoderState` | via `prev_ce_outputs` + `wait_for_buffer`, keyed on the **pointer alone** (§9.2j: no precision axis) |
//!
//! **Modelling fewer than three reports false positives.** #144 found the case
//! and it was not anticipated: 11 gap-writer edges out of one `sdpa_vector`
//! position are ordered by a session seam and by nothing else, so an audit
//! knowing only about barriers would report 11 failures on a configuration that
//! is correct. That is §11.3p's obstacle 3 defusing its obstacle 2, and no
//! barrier count shows it.
//!
//! # Why a feature, and why it composes with release
//!
//! `run-telemetry`'s shape (#171), for its reasons. An environment check is a
//! cached bool, but the code around it is still compiled and any state it
//! touches is still allocated; §6.4a measured what that costs when a hook is not
//! free -- a `String` per dispatch, 675 per token, ~3.6 % of forward-pass CPU,
//! *the same order as the thing being measured*.
//!
//! Off, every entry point below is an empty inline function that drops its
//! arguments, so there is no call to elide, no branch to predict, no counter to
//! contend on and no `Vec` to grow. The off-cost claim is therefore
//! **structural**, and the archive is the evidence rather than a timing.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! **It is not a gate.** §15.1's gates each exist because a specific failure
//! demanded them; this is diagnostic, reached for when an ordering decision is
//! being changed. Whether it becomes a gate is a later decision with its own
//! evidence.
//!
//! **It does not model `HazardKey`.** The audit asks whether the edges are
//! covered; *which* edges exist is `HazardKey`'s question, settled and measured
//! (§9.2e/§9.2f). #185 is about observing what either keying produces.
//!
//! **It under-reports nothing and over-reports deliberately.** An unknown extent
//! covers the whole allocation, so a pair whose overlap cannot be decided is
//! reported as an edge. A spurious edge costs a false positive a human reads; a
//! missed one costs the silence this exists to break.
