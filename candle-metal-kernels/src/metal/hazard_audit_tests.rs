//! Does the strict mode discriminate? (issue #185)
//!
//! **A mode that cannot report the bad case has not been shown to
//! discriminate.** #144 established why that sentence is the acceptance
//! criterion rather than a nicety: its run-heads mutation left *both* canonical
//! digest pairs byte-identical over three runs, so the project's strongest
//! outcome gate is provably blind to this class. An audit validated only against
//! a correct configuration would be a display, not a test.
//!
//! So every test below comes in pairs: the known-good predicate must report
//! **zero** uncovered edges, and a mutation of the model must report **more than
//! zero**. The mutations are the four `measurements/issue-144-raw/edge-cover.py`
//! runs, reproduced against this implementation rather than against a script:
//!
//! ```text
//!   0  PROPOSAL: suppress all 393 covered non-head   <- the question
//! 208  MUTATION: also suppress the 30 run heads      <- the bug
//! ```
//!
//! These run on a **synthetic** stream rather than a decode trace, deliberately.
//! The full-model validation is the artifact in `measurements/`, which is what
//! checks this implementation against #144's own numbers over 85595 edges; these
//! check the *mechanism* -- that each of the three primitives is modelled, that
//! each one alone is load-bearing, and that removing any of them is visible.
//! A unit test on a 554-position trace would be neither.
