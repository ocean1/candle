//! An event-driven buffer pool for the Metal backend.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The pool this replaces stored `Arc<Buffer>` in size buckets and decided a
//! buffer was reusable by testing `Arc::strong_count(b) == 1`. Because the pool
//! itself held a strong reference, that predicate was only ever true *between*
//! uses -- and nothing announced the transition. So the count had to be
//! **polled**, at two unrelated moments: a full sweep in `drop_unused_buffers`,
//! and again at every lookup in `find_available_buffer`.
//!
//! That is the actual defect. The linear scan is a consequence: with no event
//! at the instant a buffer becomes free, the only way to find a free one is to
//! look at all of them.
//!
//! # What changes
//!
//! The pool holds `Weak`, the caller holds the only strong reference, and
//! `PooledBuffer::drop` **pushes** the buffer back at the exact moment the last
//! user releases it. Lookup then pops from a free list instead of searching for
//! a free buffer.
//!
//! Reclamation stays automatic and `Drop`-driven. **No caller is required to
//! release a buffer by hand**, which is the property that makes candle's
//! allocate-and-forget ergonomics work, and the reason this is not a manual
//! `free()` API. `PooledBuffer` derefs to `Buffer`, so every existing consumer
//! -- all of which take `&Buffer` -- is unaffected.
//!
//! # Structure
//!
//! ```text
//!   free:    BTreeMap<usize, Vec<Buffer>>  size -> buffers ready to hand out
//!   pending: VecDeque<PendingBuffer>       released, waiting on the GPU
//!   live_buffers / live_bytes: usize       what callers currently hold
//! ```
//!
//! `BTreeMap` rather than `HashMap` because lookup wants the *smallest bucket
//! at least as large as the request*, which is `range(size..).next()`: one
//! ordered probe, not a scan for the minimum. Buckets that hold nothing are
//! never visited, which is what removes the pathology -- in a 400-token
//! generation the old pool accumulated 1345 bucket keys of which 1324 were
//! empty, and walked all of them on every allocation.
//!
//! # Reuse is decided on the GPU clock
//!
//! A buffer becomes reusable when **the GPU is finished with it**, not when the
//! CPU drops its last handle. Those are different instants, and the difference
//! is a correctness bug (issue #19): the CPU routinely runs a long way ahead of
//! the GPU, so a dropped buffer usually still has work outstanding on it. The
//! pool used to hand it straight back, aliasing two unrelated tensors onto one
//! allocation while the first was still being written. Measured, ~90 % of the
//! wrong values that produced were exactly another operation's correct output.
//!
//! No fence can fix that, which is why the fix is here rather than in the
//! encoder. At the instant the pool aliases two tensors, no encoder has bound
//! the buffer, so there is nothing to fence against; by the time one binds it,
//! it looks like an ordinary fresh allocation. The dependency is real and
//! invisible at every point where a fence could be emitted.
//!
//! So the release condition is GPU completion, and the CPU drop is not a second
//! predicate beside it -- it is only the signal that the buffer has no *future*
//! CPU user. One clock decides reuse. See [`GpuClock`] and `PoolInner::release`.
