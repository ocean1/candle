//! Per-dispatch recording of the Metal command stream.
//!
//! Answers "is the decode dispatch sequence identical across tokens?" — the
//! question that gates whether an `MTLIndirectCommandBuffer` can be encoded once
//! and replayed, since an ICB is only replayable if the command sequence is
//! identical between invocations.
//!
//! Off unless `CANDLE_METAL_TRACE=1`, checked once into a `OnceLock`. When off
//! the cost is one relaxed atomic load per dispatch and nothing else: no
//! allocation, no lock, no formatting. That matters because the trace has to be
//! able to run in a release build against the real model — an instrumented
//! debug build would measure a different dispatch pattern than the one shipped.
//!
//! # Buffer identity
//!
//! Raw `MTLBuffer` pointers are recorded through a stable interning table rather
//! than verbatim. Addresses are meaningless across processes and would make
//! every run's trace differ for no reason; the interned id is assigned in order
//! of first use, so two runs that allocate the same logical buffers in the same
//! order produce identical traces. That is exactly the distinction the ICB
//! question needs — "a different buffer" has to be separable from "the same
//! buffer at a different address".
//!
//! The raw address is emitted alongside the id, since the allocator question in
//! `DESIGN.md` §9 wants to know whether a logical slot is backed by a stable
//! allocation.
