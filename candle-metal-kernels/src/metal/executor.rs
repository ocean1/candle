//! How a dispatch reaches the GPU.
//!
//! `DESIGN.md` §11.1 asks for the classical command-buffer path and an ICB path
//! behind one interface, so the two can be A/B'd on the same workload. This is
//! that interface. The classical path is the default and the correctness bar;
//! it is also what already worked, so the trait is interposed in front of
//! working code rather than duplicating it.
//!
//! # Where the seam is, and why here
//!
//! Every dispatch in the crate funnels through
//! [`ComputeCommandEncoder::dispatch_thread_groups`] or `dispatch_threads` --
//! verified, no kernel reaches `MTLComputeCommandEncoder` directly. So a trait
//! at the point of *submission* sees every dispatch without touching any of the
//! 51 `call_*` entry points or the 57 sites that set pipeline state. That
//! matters more than elegance: a seam that required editing every kernel would
//! have to be re-reviewed against every kernel, and `DESIGN.md` §11.1's "must
//! not regress" is much harder to argue when the diff is that wide.
//!
//! # What an executor may and may not assume
//!
//! An executor sees dispatches in submission order and may record, forward, or
//! defer them. It may **not** change what a dispatch computes: bindings are
//! already on the encoder by the time [`Executor::dispatch`] is called, because
//! `set_params!` binds as it walks its argument list. An executor that wants to
//! replay must therefore capture bindings as they happen, which is what
//! [`Executor::will_bind_buffer`] exists for -- see `IcbFeasibility` below for
//! why no such executor is included here.

/// `kv_len`-dependent grids. There is a third, and it is not mentioned in
/// either: **an ICB command cannot carry an inline constant.**
///
/// `MTLIndirectComputeCommand` is 11 methods, enumerated from the Objective-C
/// runtime rather than read from a header:
///
/// ```text
/// setComputePipelineState:                        setBarrier
/// setKernelBuffer:offset:atIndex:                 clearBarrier
/// setKernelBuffer:offset:attributeStride:atIndex: setImageblockWidth:height:
/// concurrentDispatchThreadgroups:...              setStageInRegion:
/// concurrentDispatchThreads:...                   setThreadgroupMemoryLength:atIndex:
/// reset
/// ```
///
/// There is no `setBytes` in any form; `respondsToSelector:` is `NO` for both
/// `setKernelBytes:length:atIndex:` and `setBytes:length:atIndex:`. The same
/// holds for the render-side protocol, so this is Metal's design rather than an
/// omission.
///
/// Candle binds inline constants at essentially every dispatch -- 56
/// `set_params!` sites, and `EncoderParam` lowers every primitive to
/// `setBytes`. `call_rms_norm` is the clearest case: 77 of the 675 dispatches
/// in a decode token, passing `length`, `elements_to_sum` and `eps` inline.
/// None of the three is expressible in an ICB command.
///
/// `inheritBuffers` does not rescue it: it makes commands inherit the parent
/// encoder's bindings *identically*, so it cannot express constants that differ
/// per dispatch, which is the only reason to want them.
///
/// So an ICB path requires promoting every inline constant into a device
/// buffer. That is a prerequisite for the ICB path rather than part of it, and
/// it is recorded here and in `DESIGN.md` §11.3a as the next thing that must
/// land before this enum grows an `Icb` variant.
///
/// **Two corrections to that framing, from doing it for one file** (issue #38,
/// `DESIGN.md` §11.3c):
///
/// It is not "changing every kernel signature". Nothing is changed: a `_packed`
/// entry point is *added* beside each existing one, generated from the same
/// body, so the binding style is a compile-tier variant axis in §7.1's sense --
/// the same kind of thing as dtype -- and the classical path is never in
/// question. `reduce.metal`'s 90 variants became 180 that way.
///
/// And "the invasive refactor upstream would decline" was speculation that had
/// been repeated as fact. It originates in §8.1b, about a *build script*
/// emitting generated `.metal` into `OUT_DIR` -- a different change, with a
/// different cost. **No candle maintainer has been asked about this one.**
///
/// # Built 2026-08-26 (issue #115) -- see [`crate::metal::icb::IcbExecutor`]
///
/// The constants prerequisite above was discharged per family across #38 to #81,
/// and this note is kept because **it was not sufficient, for a reason it does
/// not state**. Every family gained a `_packed` entry point and *nothing
/// selected one*: `candle-core` calls only the classical `call_*`, each passing
/// `ParamStyle::default()`, which derived to `Split`. So an executor installed at
/// this seam would have found every position unencodable, with the whole
/// prerequisite recorded as done.
///
/// Expressible and selected are different properties. `set_default_param_style`
/// is what closes the second, and the executor covers **433 of 556 decode
/// positions** once it is set.
///
/// The other thing this note does not say, and which turned out to matter more:
/// the eleven-method list above establishes what is *absent*, and it equally
/// establishes what is *present*. `setBarrier` is in it, and an ICB whose
/// commands are `ConcurrentDispatch` carries none of candle's ordering (§3.5) --
/// so a replayed run needs those edges re-expressed on the commands themselves
/// or it computes a plausible wrong answer. Read the list in both directions.
