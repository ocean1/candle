//! GPU-resident state for the arena's bump allocator (`DESIGN.md` §9.2d, #70).
//!
//! # What this is, in one paragraph
//!
//! #69 computes every arena offset on the CPU: `Arena::acquire` maps an
//! allocation ordinal to a slot through a `Vec` lookup, on the host, once per
//! activation. This module computes the same offsets with a kernel instead --
//! one `atomic_uint` cursor in device memory, bumped in ordinal order, reset
//! once per decode step. The CPU path stays and stays selectable
//! ([`ArenaOffsets`]), the same discipline `ParamStyle` follows for binding
//! styles (§11.3b) and [`ArenaLayout`](super::ArenaLayout) for layouts: keeping
//! both live is what makes the A/B free and the parity check a comparison
//! between two paths that exist.
//!
//! # Why the offsets must be *equal*, not merely valid
//!
//! The acceptance bar for #70 is bit-identical activations, and the mechanism
//! that delivers it is stronger than a numerical tolerance: the GPU-computed
//! offset table must be **element-wise equal** to the CPU-computed one. If the
//! two agree exactly then every kernel binds the same bytes it bound before, so
//! the activations cannot differ -- bit-identity follows by construction rather
//! than by measurement. That is why [`ArenaCursor::offsets`] exists and why the
//! parity test compares tables rather than model outputs alone.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not do
//!
//! **It does not choose a buffer.** Everything is `arena_base + offset` against
//! one allocation, so residency stays a CPU-side fact established once
//! (§9.2d case 2). The GPU never selects an identity, and the design is shaped
//! so the question cannot arise.
//!
//! **It is not a free list.** §9.3: MSL `device` atomics accept only
//! `memory_order_relaxed`, so a lock-free free list has no standard correctness
//! argument available (§9.2d case 3). A bump allocator with a per-step reset is
//! sufficient because live ranges within a step are planned offline (#68) and
//! everything resets between steps.
//!
//! **It does not remove the CPU from binding.** `setBuffer_offset_atIndex` is a
//! host call, so a GPU-computed offset reaches a *classical* dispatch only by
//! being read back. That is not a regression to be apologised for, it is the
//! shape of the boundary: the offset a kernel computes can be consumed without
//! a round-trip only inside an ICB command written by an encoding kernel
//! (§11.3c, verified), and the ICB executor is explicitly out of scope for this
//! issue. What lands here is the allocator itself, GPU-resident and proven
//! equal to the CPU's, which is the mechanism a GPU-driven token loop needs
//! (§11.5) and cannot be built without.
