//! Record one decode step, encode the replayable subset into an
//! `MTLIndirectCommandBuffer`, and execute it by range (`DESIGN.md` §11.3).
//!
//! This is `DESIGN.md` §17 Phase 2 item 10, and it is deliberately **partial**.
//! §9.2i measures 123 of the 554 decode dispatch positions as varying across
//! steady-state steps under `Sdpa × arena`, and 48 of those need
//! `dispatchThreadgroupsWithIndirectBuffer` whatever the allocator does. Those
//! are not covered here and are not worked around: a second mechanism in the
//! same change would make a bisect impossible, which is the rule #64 split #82
//! out under and #82 declined again.
//!
//! # What "replayable" means here, and the axis that is easy to miss
//!
//! §9.2h and §9.2i classify the stream by what *varies* across steps -- buffer
//! identity, grid, binding offset. That is necessary and it is not sufficient.
//! An ICB command has no `setBytes` in any form (§3.7c), so a position whose
//! kernel binds its constants inline is unencodable **however stable it is**.
//! Coverage is therefore the intersection of two independent axes:
//!
//! * stable across steady-state steps (identity, grid, offset), and
//! * dispatched through a `_packed` entry point, so the constants live in a
//!   buffer a `setKernelBuffer` can bind.
//!
//! The second axis is what `set_default_param_style` exists for. Before it,
//! every decode dispatch bound its scalars inline and the covered set was
//! **empty** -- the packed variants from #38 through #81 were compiled and never
//! dispatched. Reporting only the first axis is what makes "123 positions stand
//! between here and replay" read as though closing that gap were enough.
//!
//! # Why record-then-replay, and what happens when the recording goes stale
//!
//! §11.1a gives the two options: record-and-validate, or have the model declare
//! a stable region. Candle is eager and declares nothing, so this records. The
//! validation is not a checksum over the recording -- it is that every replayed
//! position was *observed* to be invariant over the steps that were recorded,
//! and that the live step's own dispatches still match. A position that stops
//! matching falls back to the classical path for that step rather than replaying
//! a stale command, because under `HazardTrackingModeUntracked` a wrong buffer
//! is silent corruption rather than an error (§3.5).
