//! What an ICB executor would have to get right, tested before one exists.
//!
//! `DESIGN.md` §11.1 defers the ICB path; issue #32 established by probe that
//! the mechanism works on this machine and recorded three ways it fails
//! *silently*. These tests pin the one that produces plausible-looking wrong
//! output (trap 1) and the one that is a per-step obligation (trap 2), so that
//! whoever builds the executor inherits a failing test rather than a paragraph.
//!
//! They are deliberately written against raw Metal rather than through
//! `ComputeCommandEncoder`: candle has no ICB path yet, and the point is to
//! characterise Metal's behaviour, not candle's.
