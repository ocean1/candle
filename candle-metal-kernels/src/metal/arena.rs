//! The activation arena: one allocation, slots at fixed offsets.
//!
//! `DESIGN.md` §9.2. Decode activation shapes are compile-time constants (§4.2),
//! so which buffer serves a given dispatch is a question that can be answered
//! once, offline, instead of by an allocator on every token.
//!
//! # What this is for, and it is not memory
//!
//! Issue #68 measured the packing: 517 activation values fit in **5 slots,
//! 68 KB**, against a 5.2 GB pool. That is 0.0013 % — packing activations saves
//! nothing worth having.
//!
//! The payoff is **dispatch stability** (§9.2c). Buffer identity varies at all
//! 674 decode dispatch positions today (§11.1a.1), because the pool hands out a
//! different allocation for the same logical slot on every token, and ICB replay
//! needs that identity fixed. The arena makes every activation a region of one
//! buffer, so the identity a dispatch binds stops depending on allocation
//! history. **Its acceptance criterion is "674 varying → 0", not bytes saved.**
//!
//! # Layer 3, and why that is not a detail
//!
//! §9.2a: the pool has three layers, and each is optional to the one above.
//!
//! 1. automatic `Drop` reclamation — the default, and it stays
//! 2. explicit control (`trim`, unpooled handles) — opt-in, on top
//! 3. **the arena** — this module
//!
//! A slot is a `PooledBuffer` handle held by the plan for the plan's lifetime,
//! so the free list simply never sees it. That is exactly how resident weights
//! are already handled: a weight's handle is never dropped, so it is never in a
//! free list and no lookup ever looks at it (§6.3a). **No new mechanism, no
//! manual `free()`, and no exemption from the reuse path** — the reuse path is
//! defined by whether anyone lets go, and the arena simply does not.
//!
//! Do not invert this. A design that required callers to release arena buffers
//! by hand would push manual lifetime management onto every caller permanently,
//! which is the property §9.2a says any replacement must preserve.
//!
//! # Liveness keys on the value, never on the buffer
//!
//! §9.2c, and it is the trap #68 hit and self-caught. Candle's pool recycles one
//! allocation across unrelated values *within a single token*: in #68's trace
//! `buf#328` is written and fully consumed 13 times per token, and `buf#47`
//! carries 60 distinct values. Keying liveness on `(buffer, offset)` merges
//! those into one interval and invents lifetimes no activation has — #68's first
//! planner did exactly that and reported **3.55 MB against the true 68 KB**, a
//! 52× overstatement.
//!
//! In candle the buffer identity is right there in the allocation call, so the
//! wrong key is the *easier* one to reach for. This module does not key on it at
//! all: a slot is chosen by **allocation ordinal within the step**, which is a
//! property of where the allocation sits in the sequence, not of what the pool
//! happened to hand out last time. See [`ArenaPlan::acquire`].
//!
//! # Session state must not enter the arena
//!
//! §9.1 and #68's finding 4. 169 dispatch positions write values that grow
//! 128 B per token — the KV cache and the `Tensor::cat` copies it moves through.
//! Those are *session state*: per-sequence, live across steps, sized by
//! `kv_len`. A slot whose occupant grows every token cannot hold a fixed offset,
//! so everything packed after it drifts; with KV left in, **969 bindings fail
//! the 674-stability check**.
//!
//! The plan enforces this by construction rather than by classification: a
//! request whose size does not match the slot recorded for that ordinal is
//! declined and falls through to the pool (see [`ArenaPlan::acquire`]). A
//! growing KV allocation changes size every token, so it declines every token.
//! `arena_size_mismatch_declines_rather_than_drifting` pins it.
//!
//! # The hazard
//!
//! §9.3: under `HazardTrackingModeUntracked` there is **no safety net**, and
//! aliasing correctness rests entirely on this module's offset arithmetic. Every
//! layout must be validated by a parity test against a non-aliasing reference
//! layout — one where every value gets its own slot and aliasing is impossible
//! by construction. [`ArenaLayout::NonAliasing`] is that reference, and it is an
//! *execution* comparison rather than a size comparison: both layouts run the
//! real model and their outputs are compared.
