//! Variant names for the kernels in `metal_src/indexing.metal`.
//!
//! The same coupling [`crate::ConvKernel`] and [`crate::ReduceKernel`] document
//! for their files, in the last decode-path family that lacked a registry.
//! `indexing.metal` spells each `[[host_name]]` in an instantiation row, and
//! `candle-core`'s Metal backend spelled all 72 of them again in five
//! `match (ids.dtype, self.dtype)` tables of string literals. Nothing compared
//! the two, so a rename or a dtype added to one side only failed at *runtime*.
//!
//! **It had already failed.** `candle-core` named `is_i64_u8` and `is_i64_u32`;
//! `indexing.metal` declared neither, so `index_select` on a `U8` or `U32`
//! tensor with `I64` indices was a `LoadFunctionError` from inside a forward
//! pass. That is the fourth firing of the absent-variant class `DESIGN.md`
//! §8.1b tracks, after #26's 48 absent reduce variants and `conv`'s — and the
//! first found by cross-checking *across a crate boundary*, which is why it
//! survived three previous registry passes.
//!
//! `indexing_names_resolve` in `tests.rs` loads every name declared here against
//! the compiled `indexing.metal`, so a disagreement is a test failure instead of
//! a runtime one.
//!
//! # The key is a pair, and that is what is new here
//!
//! `ConvKernel` and `ReduceKernel` vary over one dtype, so a family is a list of
//! `(suffix, name)` and lookup takes a suffix. Indexing varies over **two**
//! independent dtypes — the index type and the value type — and the name
//! carries both: `is_u32_f16` is `index` over an f16 tensor with u32 indices.
//! So a family here is a list of `((index suffix, value suffix), name)` and
//! lookup takes the pair.
//!
//! That is a genuine structural difference rather than a stylistic one, and it
//! is why this is a third registry instead of a row in an existing one. The
//! `stem`/`tail` shape is kept identical to the other two so a future
//! consolidation stays mechanical.
//!
//! # Why the registry moved down rather than a suffix threading up
//!
//! `indexing`'s names were chosen a crate up, in
//! `candle-core/src/metal_backend/mod.rs`, where every other family names its
//! kernels inside `candle-metal-kernels`. Two ways to close that, and this file
//! is the first:
//!
//! * **Registry moves down** — the names are declared here and `candle-core`
//!   looks them up, exactly as it already does for `conv` via
//!   `conv_kernel_name`. The resolution test can then load every declared name
//!   against the compiled library, which is the check that catches the absent
//!   variants.
//! * **Suffix threads up** — `candle-core` learns to append `_packed`, which is
//!   what a *binding-style* axis would need.
//!
//! The second is only required once this family carries packed siblings, and it
//! is deliberately not done here: a binding-style change and a name-table change
//! have different failure modes — a wrong template substitution changes
//! numerics, a wrong binding silently corrupts slots — and landing them together
//! means a bisect cannot tell them apart. Keying on the dtype *suffix* strings
//! both crates already spell (`DType::as_str`) is what lets the registry stay
//! self-contained here, per `ConvKernel`'s reasoning: `candle-core`'s `DType`
//! has 14 variants against this crate's 6, and a cross-crate conversion would be
//! lossy in one direction.

/// A kernel family in `indexing.metal` whose variants differ by a
