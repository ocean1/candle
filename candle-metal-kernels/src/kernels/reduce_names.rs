//! Variant names for the kernels in `metal_src/reduce.metal`.
//!
//! The same coupling [`crate::ConvKernel`] documents for `conv.metal`, in the
//! file that carries the decode path's reductions: `reduce.metal` spells each
//! `[[host_name]]` in an instantiation, and callers spell it again to load a
//! pipeline. `candle-core`'s Metal backend has two `match (op, dtype)` tables
//! of string literals for the reductions, and `candle-nn` has five more for
//! softmax, the norms and RoPE. Nothing compared them with the Metal side, so a
//! rename or a dtype added to one side only failed at *runtime*.
//!
//! `reduce_names_resolve` in `tests.rs` loads every name declared here against
//! the compiled `reduce.metal`, so a disagreement is a test failure instead.
//!
//! Two shapes here that the conv registry did not have:
//!
//! * **`_strided` pairs.** Every reduction and arg-reduction is instantiated
//!   twice, contiguous and strided, from one `init_reduce` row. They are
//!   declared as separate families sharing a stem so that the spelling test
//!   still checks the full name, rather than treating the suffix as free-form.
//! * **A prefix family.** `rope`, `rope_i` and `rope_thd` come from one
//!   `init_rope` row but are three different stems, so each is its own family.
//!
//! What is deliberately *not* here is the threadgroup-size axis. `reduce.metal`
//! instantiates each kernel for eleven block sizes, but all eleven live behind
//! one `[[host_name]]` and are selected inside the kernel by a switch on
//! `block_dim`. No name varies with it, so there is nothing for a name registry
//! to check; see the comment on `reduce_switch` in `reduce.metal` for why the
//! axis stays runtime-selected.

/// A kernel family in `reduce.metal` whose variants differ only by dtype.
