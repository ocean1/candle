//! Packed parameter structs for the kernel families that carry both binding
//! styles, and the layout checks that keep them honest.
//!
//! `reduce.metal` came first (issue #38); `unary`, `binary`, `cast` and
//! `affine` followed (issue #40), then `gemv` (issue #41) and `conv` (issue
//! #42). Each family declares its own structs and its own layout kernel,
//! because each `.metal` file is compiled into its own library -- a kernel in
//! one cannot see a struct in another.
//!
//! # Why these exist
//!
//! `MTLIndirectComputeCommand` has no `setBytes` in any form (`DESIGN.md`
//! §3.7b), so a kernel that takes its scalars as `constant uint &n` cannot be
//! encoded into an ICB at all. `setKernelBuffer` is the only binding primitive
//! an ICB command has, so the scalars have to arrive in a buffer.
//!
//! `reduce.metal` therefore carries every kernel in two forms: the classical
//! one, unchanged, binding each scalar with `setBytes`; and a `_packed` one
//! taking a single `device const Params*`. Both are instantiated from the same
//! body, so this is a compile-tier variant axis in the sense of `DESIGN.md`
//! §7.1 — the same kind of thing as dtype — rather than a migration.
//!
//! # Why the layout is checked rather than trusted
//!
//! A field at the wrong offset does not crash. The kernel reads a well-formed
//! number from the wrong place and computes a plausible wrong answer, which
//! under `HazardTrackingModeUntracked` is the failure mode `DESIGN.md` §3.5 and
//! §15.1 both single out. MSL is C++14 with standard layout rules so the two
//! sides *should* agree, but "should" is what the check is for.
//!
//! Both hazards `#38` names are avoided by construction here and are worth
//! stating, because the next family converted may not be so lucky:
//!
//! * **Vector types over-align.** `float3` occupies 16 bytes in MSL, not 12
//!   (`packed_float3` exists for exactly this). No field below is a vector.
//! * **`bool` is 1 byte in MSL**, and `EncoderParam` has a `primitive!(bool)`.
//!   No field below is a `bool`.
//!
//! `size_t` in MSL is 8 bytes, which is why the RoPE structs use `u64` and are
//! 8-aligned where the reduction structs are 4-aligned. Narrowing them to `u32`
//! would have been a numeric change smuggled in beside a binding change.
//!
//! # How a family registers its check
//!
//! [`LayoutFamily`] at the foot of this file. A family is a variant, and
//! [`LayoutFamily::descriptor`] matches exhaustively, so **a family that does
//! not register does not compile** (issue #58). Before that the registration was
//! a call site in `tests.rs`, and a family omitted there was simply never
//! checked — indistinguishable from one that passed.

// `conv.metal` (issue #42).
//
// Ten families, 59 `constant &` parameters -- more than any other file bar
// `reduce`. Two things distinguish them from the reduce structs above and are
// worth stating where they are decided:
//
// * **`size_t` throughout, so these are 8-aligned** where the reduction structs
//   are 4-aligned `uint`. The one exception is `UpsampleBilinear2dParams`.
// * **`UpsampleBilinear2dParams` mixes widths.** Three `bool` (1 byte in MSL, as
//   in Rust) and two `float` sit between two `size_t`, so five of its seven
//   fields land at an offset the padding rule decides rather than at a multiple
//   of a field width. It exercises both hazards issue #38 names -- sub-word
//   types and mixed widths -- in one struct, where #40's `AffineParams` (12
//   bytes of fields, `sizeof` 16) exercises the padding half alone. Neither is
//   obvious by inspection, which is the argument for checking offsets across
//   the boundary rather than asserting them on one side.
//
// Field order mirrors each kernel's classical argument list exactly. That is
// load-bearing rather than stylistic: the packed block is built by letting the
// existing `set_params!` call run and diverting each scalar as it passes, so a
// struct whose order differs from the argument list would silently misread every
// field after the first divergence.

// `indexing.metal` (issue #81).
//
// Five families, 28 `constant &` parameters across five kernel signatures. The
// last decode-path family to carry both styles: `is_u32_f16` is the LFM2
// embedding lookup, one dispatch per token (`DESIGN.md` §11.3h).
//
// **This is the family where the `bool` hazard fires.** `DESIGN.md` §11.3b
// names two layout hazards -- vector types over-aligning, and `bool` at 1 byte
// -- and #40 recorded the second as not firing in any of the four elementwise
// families, checked by enumerating their parameters rather than assumed.
// `index` takes a `constant bool &contiguous` between five `size_t` and a
// sixth, so [`IndexParams`] is **56 bytes where its fields sum to 49**, with
// seven bytes of padding after the `bool`. `conv.metal`'s
// `UpsampleBilinear2dParams` is the only other struct in the crate with a
// `bool` in it, and it is off the decode path entirely.
//
// A width mismatch of the kind #38 found (`usize` bound to a `constant uint &`,
// benign under `setBytes` and wrong once packed) **does not occur here**,
// checked rather than assumed: `indexing.metal` declares 29 `constant size_t &`
// and one `constant bool &`, `indexing.rs` binds `usize` and `bool`
// respectively, and there is no `uint` in the file. The `()` hazard #41 found
// -- an unbound argument consuming no slot and shifting every later binding --
// does not occur either: none of the four `call_*` passes `()`.
//
// Field order mirrors each kernel's classical argument list exactly. That is
// load-bearing rather than stylistic: the packed block is built by letting the
// existing `set_params!` call run and diverting each scalar as it passes, so a
// struct whose order differs from the argument list would silently misread
// every field after the first divergence.

// `scaled_dot_product_attention.metal` (issue #103).
//
// One family, six `constant &` parameters on the `sdpa_vector` signature. The
// family became a decode-path one on 2026-08-26: #97 routed LFM2's attention
// through `sdpa_vector_float16_t_64`, 8 dispatches per token, one per attention
// layer (`DESIGN.md` §6.2a). Until then §11.3h deferred it on the ground that
// Phase 4 was about to rewrite the signature -- and Phase 4 dispatched the
// kernel *unchanged*, so the deferral's premise was discharged without the work
// being discharged with it.
//
// **The width hazard #38 names is live in this family and the classical path
// already handles it correctly.** `k_stride` and `v_stride` are
// `constant size_t &` -- 8 bytes -- where `gqa_factor` and `N` are
// `constant int &` at 4. `call_sdpa_vector` binds them as `usize` and `i32`
// respectively, which agrees. The failure #38 found (a `usize` bound to a
// 4-byte `constant uint &`, benign under `setBytes` because it writes 8 bytes
// and a little-endian 4-byte read takes the low half, and **wrong once
// packed**) is therefore absent -- checked by enumerating every `constant &`
// parameter in the file and its binding at the call site, not assumed.
//
// **The `()` hazard #41 names is absent, and the reason is different from
// every other family's.** `sdpa_vector` has optional `mask`,
// `mask_seq_stride` and `mask_head_stride` arguments, which is exactly the
// shape that produced #41's GPU hang. They are gated on the
// `sdpa_vector_has_mask` **function constant** rather than passed as `()`, so
// when it is false they are not in the signature at all -- the parameters are
// removed by the compiler rather than left unbound, and nothing consumes a
// slot that is never filled. `call_sdpa_vector` sets that constant to `false`
// unconditionally, so no call site passes `()` for them either.
//
// The mask arguments are consequently **not** fields of [`SdpaVectorParams`].
// Adding them would mean a struct whose shape depends on a function constant,
// which the layout check cannot express and which no caller wants today; a
// masked packed variant is a change to make when one does.

// `constant size_t &dim`, an optional `(num_dims, dims, strides)` triple, zero
// to two `float` scalars, and pointers. Two things distinguish them from
// `reduce.metal`'s structs and are the reason the cross-boundary check matters
// more here, not less:
//
// * **`size_t`, not `uint`.** These are 8-byte, 8-aligned where the reduction
//   structs were 4-byte, 4-aligned.
// * **Mixed widths, hence real padding.** `affine` pairs `size_t` with `float`,
//   so `AffineParams` is 16 bytes rather than the 12 its fields sum to, and
//   `AffineStridedParams` is 24 rather than 20. `reduce.metal` had no struct
//   that padded.
//
// The `bool` hazard `#38` flags does **not** fire in any of the four: no kernel
// takes a `bool` scalar. `binary.metal`'s comparison families produce `bool`
// *outputs*, which is a `device U*` buffer binding and never reaches a packed
// struct. Checked by enumerating every `constant &` parameter in the four

//
// Every family above carries a packed-parameter struct, a `<family>_params_layout`
// kernel that reports the device's view of it, and an `expected_*_layout()`
// giving Rust's. What was missing is anything that makes *checking* them
// mandatory: before this, each family added a const, a function, and a call site
// in `tests.rs`, and the call site is the one that fails silently. A family left
// out of it is not checked, and an unchecked family is indistinguishable from a
// passing one.
//
// # Why an enum and not a slice
//
// A `&[(name, fn)]` slice removes the hand-maintained *call-site list*, which is
// what the issue asks for literally. It does not remove the failure mode: a new
// family can still be omitted from the slice, and the omission is still silent.
// That relocates the defect rather than closing it.
//
// `LayoutFamily` closes it because the `match` in [`LayoutFamily::descriptor`]
// is exhaustive. Adding a variant without an arm is `error[E0004]: non-exhaustive
// patterns`, so a family that fails to register **cannot compile**, which is the
// acceptance criterion stated as a property of the language rather than of
// anyone's diligence. [`LayoutFamily::ALL`] is then the derived list the checker
// iterates, and `layout_registry_covers_every_family` asserts it names every
// variant — the one thing the compiler cannot check, since a missing entry in
// `ALL` is a short array and not a type error.
//
// # Why the slot counts are gone
//
// `LAYOUT_SLOTS`, `CONV_LAYOUT_SLOTS` and the four elementwise ones were each a
// hand-maintained integer that had to agree with the length of an array declared
// six lines below it. The descriptor takes the length from the array instead, so
// the count cannot drift from the thing it counts. The device side still gets
// checked against it: the buffer is sized from `expected.len()` and the kernel
// writes exactly that many slots.
