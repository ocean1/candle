//! FlashDecoding dispatch: partials over contiguous chunks, then an
//! index-ordered combine (`DESIGN.md` §10.4, §17 Phase 5 item 16, issue #116).
//!
//! # What this is not
//!
//! **It is not a rewiring of `call_sdpa_vector_2pass`.** That entry point ships
//! and is dispatched at `k_seq >= 1024`, which makes it easy to read as
//! FlashDecoding already existing. §10.3b establishes it is not: its chunk
//! count is **fixed at 32** whatever `kv_len` is, and its blocks read a
//! **strided interleave** rather than a contiguous range, so a block is not a
//! page, cannot be resolved through a chunk table, and cannot be the unit §10.4
//! makes equal to the page. Its index-ordered merge is safe **by accident of
//! the fixed count**, which a variable-count combine does not inherit.
//!
//! The existing 2pass is left alone as the legitimate long-`kv_len`
//! optimisation it is.
//!
//! # What it is unblocked by
//!
//! §6.2b's pre-allocated KV buffer (#142/#150), not paging. FlashDecoding needs
//! **contiguous chunks of a KV cache**, and that buffer supplies them: chunk
//! `c` is `[c*S, (c+1)*S)` at an offset into one allocation. **Paging is
//! required to stop *reserving* for them** — a footprint question costed at
//! 1.1 % of the pool at B=1 and deferred to B≥4 (§10.3i) — not to get them. The
//! chain is `#150 → #116`, and `#157 → #148`.
