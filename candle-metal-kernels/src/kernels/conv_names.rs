//! Variant names for the kernels in `metal_src/conv.metal`.
//!
//! The Metal side instantiates each kernel per dtype via macro expansion, and
//! callers have to name the resulting `[[host_name]]` string to load a
//! pipeline. Those two lists were hand-synced: `conv.metal` spells the names in
//! macro arguments, and `candle-core`'s Metal backend spelled them again in ten
//! separate `match dtype` tables. Nothing checked that the spellings agreed, so
//! a rename or a newly-supported dtype on one side failed at *runtime* — a
//! `LoadFunctionError` from deep inside a forward pass, or, where a caller had
//! a fallback path, a silent switch to the slow one.
//!
//! This table is the single place the conv family's names are written on the
//! Rust side. `conv_names_resolve` in `tests.rs` loads every name in it against
//! the compiled Metal library, so a disagreement between this table and
//! `conv.metal` is a test failure rather than a runtime one.
//!
//! Deliberately a plain table rather than generated code: `conv.metal` is
//! compiled at *runtime* by `new_library_with_source` (there is no build step
//! emitting a metallib), so the compiled library is available to a test and is
//! a stronger oracle than a generator — it checks the name against what the GPU
//! will actually be asked for, not against what a manifest said to emit.
//!
//! Lookup is keyed on the dtype *suffix* (`"f32"`, `"bf16"`, …) rather than on
//! an enum. `candle-core`'s `DType` has 14 variants against this crate's 6, and
//! the conv kernels are instantiated for 5 of them; keying on the suffix both
//! crates already spell lets the registry stay self-contained here instead of
//! requiring a lossy conversion between two enums that do not correspond.
